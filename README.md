# ✨ Form Validator Using JavaScript

A beginner-friendly project demonstrating **form validation** using **vanilla JavaScript**, **HTML**, and **CSS**.  
It covers essential JavaScript topics such as **DOM Manipulation**, **functions**, **objects**, **callback functions**, and **variables/scope**, all while building something practical and commonly used in real-world web applications.

## 🎯 Project Overview  

This project showcases how to validate form fields — such as name, email, and password — using JavaScript before the form is submitted.  
The validation ensures that the user enters correct and complete information, improving user experience and preventing invalid data submission.

You will see:

- ❌ Error messages for invalid or empty fields  
- ✔️ Success indicators for correct inputs  
- 🎨 Clean and simple UI built with CSS  
- 🧠 JavaScript controlling all validation logic  

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🔍 **JavaScript-based form validation**  
- 🖱️ Listens for submit events and checks user inputs  
- ❗ Shows dynamic error messages  
- 🎨 Minimal, responsive CSS styling  
- ⚡ No external libraries — **pure JavaScript**

---

## 🧩 How It Works

### 📂 Project Structure
- **index.html**  
  Contains the form structure, inputs, and placeholders for error messages.

- **style.css**  
  Styles the form, error states, layout, and provides visual feedback.

- **script.js**  
  Handles:
  - DOM selection  
  - Form submit event handling  
  - Validation logic  
  - Showing / hiding error messages  
  - Preventing form submission on invalid input  

### 🛠️ Validation Flow

1. User clicks **Submit**  
2. JavaScript checks each input field  
3. If validation fails:
   - An error message appears  
   - Field is highlighted  
   - Form does **not** submit  
4. If all fields are valid:
   - Form can be submitted  
   - (Or you can customize what happens next)

## 🎓 What You Learn from This Project

Even though this is a simple project, it helps understand major JavaScript topics:

- 📌 **DOM Manipulation** (selecting elements, adding classes, updating text)
- 📌 **Functions** (writing reusable validation functions)
- 📌 **Objects** (storing rules or error messages)
- 📌 **Callback Functions** (decoupling validation logic)
- 📌 **Variables / Scope** (local vs global, let/const)
